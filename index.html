    <p>Rhodes is a Greek island very close to Turkey. It has a lot of ancient history, ruins, beautiful landscape and really tasty food.</p>

    <p>Even <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rhodes&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB852GB852&oq=rhodes&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i60l3.3173j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Google</a> says so...</p>

    <blockquote>"Rhodes, the largest of Greeceâ€™s Dodecanese islands, is known for its beach resorts, ancient ruins and remnants of its occupation by the Knights of St. John during the Crusades. The city of Rhodes has an Old Town featuring the medieval Street of the Knights and the castlelike Palace of the Grand Masters. Captured by the Ottomans and then held by the Italians, the palace is now a history museum."</blockquote>
